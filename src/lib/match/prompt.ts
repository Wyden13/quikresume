Output ONE JSON object and nothing else:
{"title":"<job title>","company":"<company or empty>","summary":"<one or two sentences on the role>","requirements":[{"name":"<canonical skill/keyword>","kind":"<kind>","importance":"must"|"nice","yearsMin":<number or null>}]}

Kinds (exact ids): ${TAG_KINDS.map(k => k.id).join(", ")}.
- technical-skill: languages, frameworks, concepts. tool-platform: products, clouds, tools. domain: industries / problem areas. soft-skill: interpersonal traits and generic abilities ("Analytical Thinking", "Communication", "Problem Solving"). methodology: ways of working and engineering practices ("Agile", "CI/CD", "Software Development Lifecycle", "Documentation", "Software Testing", "Code Review", "Debugging"). credential: degrees, certifications, clearances. language: human languages.
- Hard skills (technical-skill, tool-platform, credential, language) are scored as disqualifying when missing; soft-skill and methodology entries are keyword advice. Classify accordingly: a named language, framework, product or degree is hard; a practice or trait is not, even when the posting lists it under "technical requirements".

Rules:
- 8 to 30 requirements. Merge duplicates. Skip generic filler ("team player", "fast-paced environment") unless the posting stresses it.
- "must": stated as required / must / minimum qualifications, or clearly central to the role. "nice": preferred / bonus / plus.
- Canonical names as commonly written: "PostgreSQL", "Node.js", "Amazon Web Services", "Machine Learning", "CI/CD", "Bachelor of Science". Split compounds ("React/Vue" -> two entries). No version numbers.
- Degree requirements become two entries: the level and the field, both credential. Level: "Bachelor's Degree" / "Master's Degree" / "Doctorate" when the posting says bachelor's/master's/PhD generically; the specific degree ("Bachelor of Science") only when the posting names it. Field: "Computer Science". "or a related field" makes the field entry "nice"; "or equivalent experience" makes both "nice".
- yearsMin only when the posting states a number of years for that requirement (e.g. "5+ years of Go" -> Go with yearsMin 5).
- Never invent requirements that are not in the posting.
- Valid JSON only. No markdown.`;

// ---------- reconcile: requirements vs the candidate's actual library

export const RECONCILE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a senior technical recruiter. A job's requirements are matched against a candidate's skill tags by exact name, which misses what a human sees at once. Decide, requirement by requirement, which of the candidate's OTHER tags and items also satisfy it. A requirement whose exact tag the candidate already has may still get extra satisfiers or evidence; one nothing supports is left out.

Input: {"requirements":[{"name":"...","kind":"...","importance":"must"|"nice"}],"candidateTags":[{"name":"...","kind":"...","items":<count>}],"items":[{"id":"...","section":"...","label":"...","bullets":["..."],"tags":["..."]}]}

Output ONE JSON object and nothing else:
{"matches":[{"requirement":"<requirement name, verbatim>","satisfiedBy":["<candidateTags name, verbatim>"],"evidence":["<item id>"],"reason":"<one short sentence>"}]}

How to reason (like a human reading the resume, not a keyword matcher):
- A more specific or higher credential satisfies a generic one: "Bachelor of Science" or "Master of Engineering" satisfies "Bachelor's Degree"; "B.Sc. in Computer Science" satisfies "Computer Science"; a Software Engineering degree satisfies "Computer Science" for software roles.
- A described practice satisfies the concept: an item that split a system into several services satisfies "Microservices"; deploying with Docker images on a cluster satisfies "Containerisation"; a project that trains a CNN satisfies "Deep Learning".
- A body of work satisfies a field: several substantial computer-science projects (compilers, systems, algorithms, distributed systems) evidence "Computer Science"; shipping production software evidences "Software Engineering" and "Software Development Lifecycle".
- Equivalents and supersets count ("Amazon Web Services" for "Cloud Computing"; "PostgreSQL" for "SQL" and "Relational Databases"; "React" for "Frontend Development"). The reverse does NOT: "Cloud Computing" does not satisfy "Amazon Web Services", "SQL" does not satisfy "PostgreSQL", and one named tool never satisfies a different named tool (React is not Angular, Java is not JavaScript).
- Cite evidence item ids only for items that genuinely demonstrate the requirement. Prefer satisfiedBy (tag names) when a tag fits; use evidence for cases no tag captures.
- When nothing in the library supports a requirement, leave it out. Never stretch: a hiring manager must agree with every match.
- satisfiedBy entries must be copied verbatim from candidateTags names; evidence ids verbatim from items. Valid JSON only, no markdown.`;

]}

Rules:
- At most 10 proposals. Prioritise must-have requirements that are missing or only weakly covered.
- Coverage rows carry a "tier": "hard" (named technologies, tools, degrees; missing ones are disqualifying) or "soft" (traits and practices such as "Analytical Thinking", "Documentation", "Software Testing", "Software Development Lifecycle"; missing ones are keyword advice). For a soft gap, propose a rewrite-bullet that works the keyword into a bullet that already evidences the practice, or an add-skill into a fitting category; never a "gap" proposal. Use "gap" only for hard requirements nothing supports.
- rewrite-bullet: "current" must be copied verbatim from the item's bullets. The rewrite keeps every fact, adds the requirement's keyword only where the bullet already evidences it, and may make impact more concrete. Never invent numbers, tools or outcomes.
- add-skill: only when the skill is genuinely evidenced by the candidate's other items (a tag on a work/project item) but missing from the skills section. Use the id of the best-fitting skills category.
- gap: for requirements nothing in the library supports. Say plainly what would close it (a course, a project, a certification). Do not suggest lying.
- Do not propose anything for requirements listed as muted.
- Valid JSON only. No markdown.`;

Rules:
- Start with a strong past-tense verb, 8 to 28 words, no trailing period, no first person.

Output ONE JSON object and nothing else:
{"placements":[{"skill":"<skill, verbatim>","categoryId":"<an id from categories, or null>"}]}

Rules:
- One placement for EVERY input skill.
- Match on meaning: a programming language goes with languages, a cloud service with cloud / platforms, a framework with frameworks.
- Use null when no category is a natural home; the skill then goes into a new "Technical skills" category.
- Do not invent ids. Valid JSON only. No markdown.`;

Items that cover the job's HARD requirements (named technologies, tools, degrees, languages) are locked on and are not yours to change. Your job is the SOFT side: traits, practices, methodologies and domains.

Input: {"job":{"title","company","summary"},"hardRequirements":["..."],"softRequirements":[{"name","importance"}],"locked":[{"id","section","label","bullets":[{"i","text","protected"}]}],"candidates":[{"id","section","label","proposed":"include"|"exclude","covers":["<soft requirement>"],"bullets":[{"i","text","protected"}],"skills":[{"name","protected"}]}]}

Output ONE JSON object and nothing else:
{"items":[{"id":"<candidate id>","include":true|false,"reason":"<one short sentence>"}],
 "hideBullets":[{"id":"<item id>","i":<bullet index>,"reason":"<one short sentence>"}],
 "hideSkills":[{"id":"<skills category id>","name":"<skill, verbatim>","reason":"<one short sentence>"}]}

How to decide:
- Return one entry in "items" for EVERY candidate: confirm the proposed decision or flip it, and justify it in plain words a candidate understands ("Shows stakeholder communication the role stresses").
- Include items that genuinely evidence the job's soft requirements, especially must-haves. Exclude items that add nothing for this job, or that repeat what included items already show.
- A resume should fit on one page: prefer fewer, stronger items.
- Hide bullets (in locked or included candidate items) that are irrelevant to this job. Never hide a bullet or skill marked "protected": it names a hard requirement.
- Hide skills in skill categories only when they are clearly irrelevant to this job.
- Do not invent ids or indexes. Valid JSON only, no markdown.`;
